The key of this technique is to understand that when either an idea, an image or a mental association appears in our minds to distracts us from our practice, we must redirect our attention back to the screen and become aware of the projected color. It’s essential to not be expecting or looking for anything in particular, it’s all about being aware of what’s happening at the moment.</p><p class="violet"><b class="bold">On the next screen, you will be shown a sequence of colors at different intervals of time. Draw your attention to the different colors as they appear.</b></p><p>Just observe. It’s not about thinking in the colors or relate them with your personal tastes, objects or specific memories.</p><p>When you realize that you have been distracted, look at what it is that caught your attention and immediately return to observe the color that is on the screen, focusing only on the breathing that emerges at that moment.
