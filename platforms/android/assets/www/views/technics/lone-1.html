Remember that you can be around people but still feel alone, and this may be because you feel that other people don't share with you the things you consider important, or maybe you don't share your world with them because you think they wouldn't understand, enjoy, or give the importance you give to it.</p><p>You must understand that like most mental phenomena, these are constructions we make based on our beliefs and our mental model. These constructions can be deconstructed or modified.</p><p>To escape from the feeling of loneliness doesn't necessarily mean being with others; those who read a great book or enjoy a favorite song, who goes for a walk to appreciate the landscape, who prepares a meal with passion, they for sure aren't feeling alone, their own company is enough for them.</p><p>We suggest that you evaluate yourself with this simple test to determine how problematic this is for you and in which category you fit in.</p></div></div><div class="row last-row"></div>
